# Project Description-
* At first, The system create dataset with name & facial image. 
* Pre-process the image with 400x400 dimension.
* Train these image for getting accurate output.
* The system is trained using **VGG16** convolutional neural network model.

## Output of the project-
* Using camere the system takes input image.
* Finally the system gives the name of the facial image & accuracy rate.

## Precautions-
* At training & testing period, Always the system will want human facial image.
* Otherwise It will discard the image.
